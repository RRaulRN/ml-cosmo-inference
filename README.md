Neural-network emulators for CMB observables beyond Flat LambdaCDM
Work is organized as follows:
- NN cosmo emulators: three NN, each with their own pipelines from Datageneration to NN testing
- Planck SMICA fit: revised version of third NN, focused towards CMB experimental data. Inclues power spectrm estimates calculated from Planck SMICA data and MCMC chains.
